# About
This program tests the user's knowledge of combinations problems. Specifically, the problems ask how many cominbations of r items can be taken from a set of n items. The program generates a random problem and asks the user to provide an answer to it. It then calculates the problem and informs the user whether their answer was right or wrong. The program continues generating random problems until the user indicates that they want to quit the program. Then, a score is provided that tells how many problems the user solved correctly out of how many total problems the user attempted.

Problems are all solved using the formula n!/(r!(n-r)!). You can read more about combinations problems at the Wikipedia article [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combination). The calculation of this formula is implemented recursively.

# Operating Instructions
On Windows, you can compile and run this program in Visual Studio. You will need to configure the IDE for MASM x64. See tutorial [here](http://www.asmirvine.com/gettingStartedVS2019/index.htm).
