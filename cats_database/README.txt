Title: Cat Database
Description:
This program enables a user to create, maintain, and modify a database of cat breeds.
The program can load a pre-existing file of data. For the formatting of this file, each data entry must
be on one line, and each data field must be separated by a comma (breed,characteristics,group,weight ,height,country).

For example:
persian,calm,long-hair,10,11,Iran
siamese,intelligent,short-hair,9,Thailand

Features include adding a new breed to the database, searching for a breed, deleting a breed, and
printing the contents of the database to the console. Upon the user terminating the program, the data
is saved the the same file that was initially loaded. The output file is in the same format described above.
