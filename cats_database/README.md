# Cats Database
## About
This program allows you to maintain a document of cat breeds with their corresponding attributes. Information is read from, and written to, a text file. The program allows you to add a breed, search for a breed, remove a breed, and list all of the breeds in the document.
## Input
If you are using a file with information already written to it, it must be in the format:

breed_name,temperament,group,weight,height,country_of_origin

Each breed takes up one line, and attributes are separated by commas.
## Sample Input
