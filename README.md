# About
This repository includes several programming projects that were completed as coursework for my Bachelor's degree in computer science. Thus far, all of the programs included here are command line tools.
The following is a brief description of each project (in order from most recently completed):

## Sweepstakes Solver
Determines what items each member of a family should take from a store to maximize the value of total items. This program is implemented with dynamic programming.
**Language:** C++

## Spell Checker
Takes a word inputted by the user and checks the spelling. If the spelling is incorrect, the program outputs five suggestions for correction. This program is implemented with a hash map
and Levenstein's algorithm.
**Language:** C

## Combinations Genearator
This program tests a user's knowledge of combinations problems (how many combinations of r items can be taken from a set of n items) by generating random problems for the user
to solve. Problems are solved by the program with recursion.
**Language:** Assembly

## Cats Database
This program allows the user to build or add to a document that contains information about cat breeds.
**Language:** C++
