# About
This program considers families who have won a contest to take whatever items they want from a store. Each family member has a limit for how much weight he or she can carry, and each family member may only take one of each item. Each item has a designated price and weight. The objective of the program is to calculate which items each family member should take in order to maximize the value of items taken for the entire family. The program can solve the problem for multiple families. The implentation uses dynamic programming.
